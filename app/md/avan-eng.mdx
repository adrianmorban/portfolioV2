This project involved the development of an electronic invoicing system designed to simplify and automate the issuance of fiscal invoices. Using Vue.js and Laravel, the platform integrates with the DGII API, ensuring regulatory compliance and facilitating the management of fiscal documents.

### Key Features

The system allows for the generation of electronic fiscal invoices, invoice correction, and integration with QuickBooks to manage clients and products. Additionally, all generated invoices are stored in QuickBooks, optimizing accounting processes and access to relevant information.
