This project involved the development of a ecommerce website from scratch for a consulting company that offers a wide range of products and services, including participation in conferences, specialized tools, and diploma programs. The platform, created in collaboration with a team member, was developed with a focus on automating sales and subscriptions, providing convenient and direct access to the company's resources.

### Technologies and Architecture

The store was built using Laravel for the backend and Vue.js for the frontend, achieving a solid, scalable, and secure architecture. The choice of Laravel facilitated the creation of APIs and the database structure, while Vue.js enabled a dynamic, user-friendly interface. Integration with the Azul payment gateway ensures that customers can make purchases and manage subscriptions reliably and securely.

### Key Features

For customers, the platform offers two purchase models: a one-time payment system for specific products and a subscription model, suitable for recurring services like memberships and access to online events. The subscription system automates monthly billing, allowing customers uninterrupted access to contracted resources while the company eliminates the need for a person exclusively dedicated to manual monthly billing.

For platform administrators, an admin panel is available where they can view a history of transactions, registered users, and all active subscriptions. They can also modify, create, and deactivate items as needed.

### Design and User Experience (UX)

The design of the ecommerce website was built around the visual identity of the consulting company, using its colors, logo, and graphic style to reflect professionalism and trust. Navigation is intuitive, optimized for customers to easily find all available services and products.

### Development Process

Project management included communication with the client to define requirements, as well as planning and overseeing development. As the project lead, I was responsible for maintaining clear communication with the client and coordinating tasks with my collaborator, ensuring the work aligned with expectations and the agreed-upon deadlines.

### Results and Impact

The platform is currently in use and has brought significant change to the company by automating subscription billing and providing greater control and efficiency in managing recurring services. This project has not only improved the customer experience but has also optimized internal processes, resulting in time and resource savings for the company.
